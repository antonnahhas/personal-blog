                <p>I started my journey in Computer Science 5 years ago, and it has been an incredible ride so far. From the initial days of learning and experimenting to now sharing my expertise and stories, I have enjoyed every bit of it. My blog is a reflection of my journey, filled with learnings, challenges, and moments of triumph.</p>

                <p>I have already built websites using other tech-staks, I wanted to challenge myself in something new, that's when I chose Laravel, PHP, and MySQL. Why you ask? Why not? learning is wonderful and adding skills to my skillset is something I am seeking and working on! That is why with the help of the internet and the skill of reading documentations I could built this fully functional Blog.</p>
